- add some sort of traversal feature to find #includes
    - do a depth first search and keep track of visited nodes, if an edge takes you back to a visited node then it has a cycle
    - output the files that are included in the cycle
- could add some additional features to include custom imports (i.e. rules)
- handling extra command line flags (debugging, optimization, compiler)
